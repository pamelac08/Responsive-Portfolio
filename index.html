      <p>Hello!  Greeting from Waco, Tx - where I currently call home.  
        Originally from Ruston, LA and a Louisiana Tech Alumnus (Go Dawgs!!), 
        I have lived in 5 different cities across the US plus numerous other 
        countries for short stints.  To say I enjoy traveling would be a massive 
        understatement.  I love experiencing different cultures and even just the 
        process and logistics of travel.  That’s probably weird, I know, but alas I 
        do love it.  There are definitely many more places yet to visit and/or live!</p>

      <p>A few years ago with several years of working for the VA as an Engineer/Project 
        Manager under my belt, I set out to change the world.  Long story short, 
        I have made my way to Waco where I am pursuing a career shift with coding/web 
        development - something I have been thinking about for what seems like a very 
        long time.  Fueled by coffee and CrossFit, I am excited to see what this journey 
        holds next!  </p>
